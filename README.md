# Comparing cosmetics by ingredients: a data-driven approach
Are you tired of feeling uncertain about which cosmetic products to try? Reading ingredient lists at the back of the product can be overwhelming, especially if you're not a chemist. This project aims to help predict which products might be the best fit for you using data science.

We'll process ingredient lists for 1472 cosmetics from Sephora using word embedding, and then visualize ingredient similarity using t-SNE and the interactive visualization library Bokeh. The goal is to create a content-based recommendation system using the chemical components of cosmetics as our content.

## Prerequisites
- Bokeh
